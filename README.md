# ROSE Pool by White Rose Staking

In this project we are hosting a staking pool for cardano network. 
We are aware our node performance hasn't kicked off yet but we believe in ₳D₳ and like to support the decentralization

If you share the mantra "Not your keys - Not your coins" please search for ROSE and delegate to our staking pool.

We are a group of crypto enthusiasts with a professional background in IT
